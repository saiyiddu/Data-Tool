## Steps: 1) Take in excel file 2)have a for loop to go through the sheets in the file 3) that will save each sheet as a new csv file with the same name as the sheet 
##input: xls file --> csv file 
import csv
import xlrd
  
## on_demand: should sheets be downloaded or called upon?
book = xlrd.open_workbook('pigs (3).xls')
for sheet in book.sheets():
    sheet_name = sheet.name
    print sheet_name
    ## Create new csv with same name as sheet 
    with open(sheet_name, 'wb') as myfile:
      ## writer(data, quote all fields)
      wr = csv.writer(myfile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)
      
      ##identify and write header (otherwise will start from field value)

      header = [cell.value for cell in sheet.row(0)]
      wr.writerow(header)

      for row_idx in range(1, sheet.nrows):
          row = [int(cell.value) if isinstance(cell.value, float) else cell.value
                   for cell in sheet.row(row_idx)]
          wr.writerow(row)

    ##for i in range(sheet.nrows):
      ##print sheet.row_values(i)
